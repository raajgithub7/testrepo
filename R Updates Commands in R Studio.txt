To update R on Windows, try using the package installr (only for Windows)




install.packages("installr") 

library(installr)

updateR()  





This will start the updating process of your R installation by: “finding the latest R version, downloading it, running the installer, deleting the installation file, copy and updating old packages to the new R installation.”
From within RStudio, go to Help > Check for Updates to install newer version of RStudio (if available, optional).
